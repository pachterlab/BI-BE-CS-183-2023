  abstract      = "RNA-Seq is rapidly becoming the standard technology for
                   transcriptome analysis. Fundamental to many of the
                   applications of RNA-Seq is the quantification problem, which
                   is the accurate measurement of relative transcript
                   abundances from the sequenced reads. We focus on this
                   problem, and review many recently published models that are
                   used to estimate the relative abundances. In addition to
                   describing the models and the different approaches to
                   inference, we also explain how methods are related to each
                   other. A key result is that we show how inference with many
                   of the models results in identical estimates of relative
                   abundances, even though model formulations can be very
                   different. In fact, we are able to show how a single general
                   model captures many of the elements of previously published
                   methods. We also review the applications of RNA-Seq models
                   to differential analysis, and explain why accurate relative
                   transcript abundance estimates are crucial for downstream
                   analyses.",
